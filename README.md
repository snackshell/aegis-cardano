# Aegis: Your AI Security Guardian for Cardano

**Project Status: Proposed for Funding in Project Catalyst Fund14**

Aegis is an open-source project aimed at making the Cardano ecosystem the safest place to operate in Web3. We are building an AI-powered security assistant that helps users and developers identify scams, understand transactions, and protect their assets.

## The Problem

The fear of scams is a major barrier to mass adoption. As the Cardano ecosystem grows, users are increasingly exposed to sophisticated phishing attacks, malicious dApps, and confusing transactions designed to drain their wallets. This creates a climate of fear that slows down growth and hurts user trust.

## Our Solution

Aegis provides a free, intelligent, and easy-to-use security layer for everyone. Our primary deliverable is an **open-source security API** that any Cardano developer can integrate into their applications.

To demonstrate its power and provide immediate value to the community, we will also build and maintain a free public **Telegram and Discord bot** that offers:

* **AI Link Scanner**: Analyzes websites for signs of phishing or wallet drainers.
* **Address Reputation Check**: Scans wallet addresses for suspicious on-chain activity.
* **Asset Authenticity Verification**: Confirms if an NFT or token is genuine by checking its Policy ID.
* **Plain-Language Transaction Explainer**: Translates complex transaction data into a simple, human-readable summary *before* you sign.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to build a foundational trust layer for Cardano. By providing developers with a powerful, open-source security toolkit, we can collectively make the entire ecosystem safer, encouraging new users to join with confidence and empowering developers to build more secure applications.

## Roadmap (6 Months)

* **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):**
    * [ ] Set up public GitHub repository with MIT License.
