# Aegis: Your AI Security Guardian for Cardano

**Project Status: Community-Funded in Project Catalyst Fund14 | In Active Development**

Aegis is an open-source project building an AI-powered security assistant to help users and developers identify scams, understand transactions, and protect their assets on the Cardano blockchain. Our goal is to make the Cardano ecosystem the safest place to operate in Web3.

## The Problem
The fear of scams is a major barrier to mass adoption. As the Cardano ecosystem grows, users are increasingly exposed to sophisticated phishing attacks, malicious dApps, and confusing transactions designed to drain their wallets. This creates a climate of fear that slows down growth and hurts user trust.

---
## Our Solution
Aegis provides a free, intelligent, and easy-to-use security layer for everyone. We are developing an **open-source security API** that any Cardano developer can integrate into their applications.

To demonstrate its power and provide immediate value, we're also building a free public **Telegram and Discord bot** that offers:

* **AI Link Scanner**: Analyzes websites for signs of phishing or wallet drainers.
* **Address Reputation Check**: Scans wallet addresses for suspicious on-chain activity.
* **Asset Authenticity Verification**: Confirms if an NFT or token is genuine by checking its Policy ID.
* **Plain-Language Transaction Explainer**: Translates complex transaction data into a simple, human-readable summary *before* you sign.

---
## Project Vision
Our vision is to build a foundational trust layer for Cardano. By providing developers with a powerful, open-source security toolkit, we can collectively make the entire ecosystem safer, encouraging new users to join with confidence and empowering developers to build more secure applications.
